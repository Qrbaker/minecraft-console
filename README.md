# minecraft-console
Bash scripts for managing Minecraft servers.

These scripts can really manage any Java server, if they are configured correctly.

`console` manages the server's startup, shutdown, backups, and much more.

`listener` will watch a log file, and perform actions based on what the server prints to the file.

Both are simply configureable, and I can add more information if people actually want it.
